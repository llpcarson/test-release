\section{CCPP Overview}

The Common Community Physics Package (CCPP) is a library of physical parameterizations for atmospheric numerical models. It is distributed with a driver that enables its use with any host application. In this release, the CCPP has been bundled with the Global Model Test Bed Single Column Model (SCM) and contains all the physical parameterizations used in the operational NOAA Global Forecast System (GFS) implemented operationally in July 2017.

This Quick Start Users' Guide provides basic instructions for using the CCPP with the GMTB SCM.  Please refer to the release web page for further documentation and user notes.
