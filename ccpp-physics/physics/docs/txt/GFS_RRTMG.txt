\section des_rrtmg 1. Description
 Radiative processes are among the most complex and
 computationally intensive parts of all model physics. As an
 essential component of modeling the atmosphere, radiation directly
 and indirectly connects all physics processes with model dynamics,
 and it regulates the overall earth-atmosphere energy exchanges and
 transformations.

 The schematic radiation module structure is shown in Table 1.

 GFS radiation package is intended to provide a fast and accurate
 method of determining the total radiative flux at any given
 location. These calculations provide both the total radiative flux
 at the ground surface, which is needed to establish the surface
 energy budget, and the vertical radiative flux divergence, which is
 used to calculate the radiative heating and cooling rates of a given
 atmospheric layer. The magnitude of the terms in the surface energy
 budget can set the stage for moist deep convection and are crucial
 to the formation of low-level clouds. In addition, the vertical
 radiative flux divergence can produce substantial cooling,
 particularly at the tops of clouds, which can have strong dynamical
 effects on cloud evolution.

 It uses a correlated-k distribution method and a transmittance lookup
 table that is linearly scaled by optical depth to achieve high
 accuracy and efficiency. The algorithm contains 140 unevenly
 distributed quadrature points (reduced from the original set of 256)
 to integrate the cumulative probability distribution functions of
 absorption over 16 spectral bands. It employs the
 Clough-Kneizys-Davies (CKD_2.4) continuum model (Clough et al. 1992
 \cite clough_et_al_1992) to compute absorption by water vapor at the
 continuum band. Longwave cloud radiative properties external to the
 RRTM depend on cloud liquid/ice water path and the effective radius
 of ice particles and water droplets (Hu and Stamnes 1993
 \cite hu_and_stamnes_1993; Ebert and Curry 1992 \cite ebert_and_curry_1992).

 Changes to Radiation Parameterization since 2007:
 \n The longwave (LW) and the shortwave (SW) radiation
 parameterizations in NCEP's operational GFS are both modified and
 optimized versions of the Rapid Radiative Transfer Model for GCMs
 (RRTMG_LW v2.3 and RRTMG_SW v2.3, respectively) developed at AER
 (Iacono et al. 2008 \cite iacono_et_al_2008,Mlawer et al. 1997
 \cite mlawer_et_al_1997, Iacono et al., 2000 \cite iacono_et_al_2000,
 Clough et al., 2005 \cite clough_et_al_2005). The LW algorithm
 contains 140 unevenly distributed g-points (quadrature points) in 16
 broad spectral bands, while the SW algorithm includes 112 g-points
 in 14 bands. In addition to the major atmospheric absorbing gases of
 ozone, water vapor, and carbon dioxide, the algorithm also includes
 various minor absorbing species such as methane, nitrous oxide,
 oxygen, and in the longwave up to four types of halocarbons (CFCs).
 To represent statistically the unresolved subgrid cloud variability
 when dealing multi layered clouds, a Monte-Carlo Independent Column
 Approximation (McICA) method is used in the RRTMG radiative transfer.
 A maximum-random cloud overlap method is used in both LW and SW
 radiation calculations. Cloud condensate path and effective radius
 for water and ice are used for the calculation of cloud-radiative
 properties. Hu and Stamnes's method (1993) \cite hu_and_stamnes_1993
 is used to treat water clouds in both LW and SW parameterizations.
 For ice clouds. Fu's parameterizations (1996,1998) \cite fu_1996
 \cite fu_et_al_1998 are used in the SW and LW, respectively.

 In the operational GFS, a climatological tropospheric aerosol with
 a 5-degree horizontal resolution is used in both LW and SW
 radiations. A generalized spectral mapping formulation was developed
 to compute radiative properties of various aerosol components for
 each of the radiation spectral bands. A separate stratospheric
 volcanic aerosol parameterization was added that is capable of
 handling volcanic events. In SW, a new table of incoming solar
 constants is derived covering time period of 1850-2019 (Vandendool,
 personal communivation). An eleven-year solar cycle approximation
 will be used for time out of the window period in long term climate
 simulations. The SW albedo parameterization uses surface vegetation
 type based seasonal climatology similar to that described in the
 NCEP OFFICE Note 441 (Hou et al. 2002 \cite hou_et_al_2002) but with
 a modification in the treatment of solar zenith angle dependency over
 snow-free land surface (Yang et al. 2008 \cite yang_et_al_2008).
 Similarly, vegetation type based non-black-body surface emissivity
 is used for the LW radiation. Concentrations of atmospheric
 greenhouse gases are either obtained from global network
 measurements, such as carbon dioxide (CO2), or taking the
 climatological constants, the actual CO2 value for the forecast time
 is an estimation based on the most recent five-year observations. In
 the lower atmosphere (<3km) a monthly mean CO2 distribution in 15
 degree horizontal resolution is used, while a global mean monthly
 value is used in the upper atmosphere.
