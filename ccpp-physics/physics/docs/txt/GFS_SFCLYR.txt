\section des_rough  1. Description
 It is the surface roughness length calculation based on
 the surface sublayer scheme from Zeng and Dickinson (1998)
 \cite zeng_and_dickinson_1998.

 \ref Noah_Main are largely responsible for the quality
 of model forecasts produced for near-surface weather parameters, such
 as 2-meter air temperature (\f$T_{2m}\f$) and surface skin temperature
 (\f$LST\f$). \f$LST\f$ is derived from the surface energy budget, and is
 particularly important to remote sensing and data  assimilation. How
 precise these two parameters can be simulated by the model strongly
 depends on how accurate the surface heat fluxes are parameterized,
 particularly the surface sensible heat flux (\f$SH\f$). The surface
 thermal roughness length is a key parameter to determine \f$SH\f$.
 Previous GFS version do not distinguish between the roughness length
 for heat and momentum. The aerodynamic roughness \f$Z_{0m}\f$ is used
 for wind, while the thermal roughness \f$Z_{0t}\f$ is used for heat and
 water vapor. In general, \f$Z_{0m}\f$ is different from \f$Z_{0t}\f$,
 because the transfer of momentum is affected by pressure fluctuations
 in the turbulent waves behind the roughness elements, while for heat
 and water vapor transfer no such dynamical mechanism exists. Zeng and
 Dickinson (1998) \cite zeng_and_dickinson_1998 found that the surface
 skin temperature can be at least 10 K higher when considering the surface
 sublayer (or the variable ratio of the \f$Z_{0m}/Z_{0t}\f$ ) than without
 in the desert summer afternoon.

 In May 2011, the new vegetation-dependent formulations of
  thermal roughness formulation (Zheng et al. 2009
 \cite zheng_et_al_2009; Zheng et al. 2012 \cite zheng_et_al_2012 )
 was implemented to deal with the cold \f$LST\f$ bias
 over the arid western continental United States
 (CONUS) during daytime. This \f$LST\f$ bias contributes to large errors in
 simulated satellite brightness temperatures over land by the Community
 Radiative Transfer Model (CRTM) and hence the rejection of satellite
 data in the NCEP Gridpoint Statistical Interpolation (GSI) system,
 especially for surface-sensitive satellite channels.

 Figure 1 show the 3 day average land surface skin temperature predicted
 by the GFS and comparison with the GOES-derived satellite measurements.
 At 18:00 UTC (midday in local time over the central United States) in
 the control run (Figure 1a), a substantial cold bias can be found over
 the west half of CONUS (i.e., arid or semiarid regions). The new roughness
 length formulations significantly reduce the cold bias in the western
 CONUS, while the \f$LST\f$ in the eastern CONUS, where the bias is small in
 the control run, is not much affected.

 The Desert Rock station (\f$36.63^oN\f$, \f$116.02^oW\f$), located in the Nevada
 desert,is one of the observation stations within the SURFRAD network.
 The GOES-derived \f$LST\f$ is very similar to the SURFRAD obervations (Figure 2).
 However, the old GFS run produces very low \f$LST\f$, compared to the observations,
 especially during daytime. During midday, the cold bias can reach up to
 \f$-15^oC\f$. The new formulation run produces a reasonable \f$LST\f$ diurnal cycle.
 The daytime \f$LST\f$ increases substantially and is very close to the observations.
