\section des_shal 1. Description
 The scale-aware mass-flux shallow (SAMF_shal) convection
 scheme is an updated version of the previous mass-flux shallow
 convection scheme with scale and aerosol awareness and
 parameterizes the effect of shallow convection on the environment.
 The SAMF_shal scheme is similar to the SAMF deep convection scheme
 but with a few key differences. First, no quasi-equilibrium assumption
 is used for any grid size and the shallow cloud base mass flux is
 parameterized using a mean updraft velocity. Further, there are no
 convective downdrafts, the entrainment rate is greater than for deep
 convection, and the shallow convection is limited to not extend over
 the level where \f$p=0.7p_{sfc}\f$. The paramerization of scale and
 aerosol awareness follows that of the SAMF deep convection scheme.

 The previous version of the shallow convection scheme (shalcnv.f)
 is described in Han and Pan (2011) \cite han_and_pan_2011 and differences
 between the shallow and deep convection schemes are presented in
 Han and Pan (2011) \cite han_and_pan_2011 and Han et al. (2017)
 \cite han_et_al_2017 . Details of scale- and aerosol-aware parameterizations
 are described in Han et al. (2017) \cite han_et_al_2017 .
